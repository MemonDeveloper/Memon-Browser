## Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

Before you can run Memon Browser, ensure you have the following installed:

  * **Python 3.x**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  * **PyQt5**: The core GUI framework.
  * **PyQtWebEngine**: Required for rendering web content.

## Installation üíª

1.  **Clone the repository** (or download the `main.py` file directly):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Memon-Browser.git
    cd Memon-Browser
    ```
2.  **Create a `requirements.txt` file**: In the root directory of your project, create a file named `requirements.txt` and paste the following content:
    ```
    PyQt5
    PyQtWebEngine
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

1.  **Prepare assets**: The browser uses a few image files for icons and animations. For the best experience, place the following files in the same directory as `main.py`:

      * `spinner.gif` (for the loading animation)
      * `zoom-in.png` (for the zoom dialog icon)
      * `warning.png` (for the tab limit warning icon)
        If these files are missing, the browser will still function, but these visual elements won't appear.

2.  **Run the script**:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

The browser window will open, maximized by default. You can start typing URLs or search queries into the address bar.

## Output Excel Format üìä

This browser does not produce an Excel output. This section is typically for data extraction scripts.

-----

## Important Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è

  * **Custom UI**: The browser uses a frameless window, meaning standard operating system window controls are replaced by custom buttons.
  * **Missing Assets**: As mentioned in the "Prepare assets" section, ensure `spinner.gif`, `zoom-in.png`, and `warning.png` are present for a complete visual experience. You can use any GIF for the spinner and any suitable PNG icons.
  * **`Ctrl+W` Shortcut**: This shortcut is implemented to quickly close the current tab. If no tabs are left, the browser will close.
  * **Tab Limit**: There's a maximum of 25 tabs to manage performance and resources.
